In this project we analyze Covid-19 data gathered from January 2020 to June 2022.

I used Microsoft Excel to scrape the data from Kaggle.com, I also used Excel to sort, merge, analyze the data and created a dashboard to visualise the analysis.
First I collected the data for confirmed cases across the Globe.

I also collected data that shows the number of deaths that occured.

Then I collected data for the number of people that recovered from Covid.

After collecting the data needed, I merged the three data tables together to form one comprehensive table.

After merging, I moved to the analysis stage by creating pivot tables to gather insights about the data.

From the pivot tables, I created various charts to visualise the insights gathered.

From this chart showing the top 5 countries with highest prevalence of Covid, we can see that the United States of America had the highest number of confirmed cases during the period reviewed.
